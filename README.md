# Pipeline for analysis of Z-linked and autosomal genomic variation in barn swallows

Below are details about the data processing and analysis steps in our analysis of genetic diversity and differentiation across the genomes of barn swallow populations, focusing on comparisons between the Z chromosome and autosomes to understand the mechanisms governing sex-linked variation and the role of the Z chromosome in speciation.
